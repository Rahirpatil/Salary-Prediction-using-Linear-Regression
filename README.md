💼 Salary Prediction using Linear Regression
This project aims to predict the salary of a person based on their years of experience using Linear Regression, one of the simplest and most popular machine learning algorithms.

📘 Overview
Predicting salaries based on experience is a classic regression problem. This project walks through the process of:

Loading and exploring the data

Visualizing the relationship
Splitting the data for training and testing
Building a Linear Regression model
Predicting results

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

Python – Programming language
Pandas – For reading and processing data
Matplotlib – For visualizing the relationship
Scikit-learn – To apply Linear Regression

📁 Dataset
File Name: salary_data.csv

Features:

YearsExperience: Number of years a person has worked
Salary: Corresponding salary in ₹ or $
This is a small dataset often used to teach linear regression concepts.

🔍 Project Flow

1. Load and Understand the Data
The dataset is loaded and basic inspection is done to understand the columns and structure.

2. Visualize the Data
A scatter plot is created to show how salary increases with experience. This helps confirm a linear trend.

3. Train-Test Split
The data is split into a training set to train the model and a test set to evaluate how well the model works.

4. Model Training
A Linear Regression model is trained to find the best-fit line that explains the relationship between experience and salary.

5. Prediction
Once trained, the model can predict salaries for new or test experience values.

6. User Input
The program accepts user input for years of experience and shows the predicted salary.
